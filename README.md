# Team-Profile-Generator-Pedro-Guerra

## Description

In this bootcamp challenge, the main goal is to build a code from scratch that successfully generates team members and their profile information.

## Installation

If a user runs into an inquirer issue, the user should then run the command "npm i" on their terminal, and that should install all the needed files in order to then be able
to successfully run "node index" in order to start generating the team members' profiles.

## Usage

A user will be provided a series of questions. The answers to the questions will generate the profile information for each team member. Depending on which area the 
employee is classified as, they will be prompted with a question about their github username if they are an engineer, or a question about what school they are attending/attended if they are an intern.
